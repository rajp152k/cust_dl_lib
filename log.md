# PROGRESSION LOG

## setup

	- set up git and colab to interact 
	- python and log files edited on my pc
	- ipynbs edited on colab
	- created a testing framework
		- shows all the exceptions 

# Core objectives:
	
	- create a simple neural net with all the functionalities implemented from scratch
	- once a functionality has been written, can use the corresponding on from standard libraries
	- sample case: MNIST : a relatively shallower deep neural net : for testing and learning purposes
	- followed by implementation of compentent architectures built from scratch

## Matrix multiplication:

	- progression: looping--:element wise operation--:broadcasting--:einstein summations
	- testing on MNIST
		- creating a forward pass with a weight matrix 

## Propogation

	- implementing forward and backward passes for a single hidden layer
	- studied effects of initialisation 
		- read the Kaiming He initialisation paper
	- maintaining variance of activations close to 1 
		- to allow deeper networks to converge efficiently
